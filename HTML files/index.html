        I have my own design studio where I provide services such as retouching, design and web design.
        I have a strong work ethic and believe in delivering promptly. This attitude has enabled me to
        be the number one go-to guy when large multi-national companies need help at busy periods on a freelance basis.
        For over 25 years I have been in the Reprographics industry offering photo retouching services to
        international fashion retail clients both in print and for the internet. This particular image editing
        is high end retouching and consists of creative retouching and also color retouching.
        Although this is the bulk of my business, I still like the one-time projects from both companies and
        individuals. So if you need me for photo retouching on that next big modeling shoot or you just want some
        embarrassing uncle retouching out of your wedding photos or a new background dropping in then contact me! The type
        of work I do includes (but not limited to) color retouching, creative retouching, skin tones, swatch matching,
        backgrounds,
        compositions, mapping etc. There isn't much I cannot do with Photoshop and a great imagination!<br></td>
